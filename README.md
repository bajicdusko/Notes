It is a non-working solution for adding the simple notes into the local storage.

or due to wrong test implementation. Some debugging might be needed to resolve all issues in the app. 
Fork this repository and push your woring solution onto your branch. 
Pull requests to this repository wont be accepted.

### Architecture components usage
Application is developed in MVVM architecture in mind with usage of architecture components like Room, ViewModel and LiveData.
As architecture components are not part of the course this project belongs to, implementation related to Room, LiveData 
and Room is fully working.
